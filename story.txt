Jim is buying a parrot

　　Are you sure it doesnt scream, yell, or swear? Jim asked

　　Oh absolutely. Its a religious parrot, the storekeeper assures him.

　　Do you see those strings on his legs? When you pull the right one, he recites the lords prayer, and when you pull on the left he recites the 23rd Psalm.

　　Wonderful!  Jim said, but what happens if you pull both strings?

　　I fall off my perch, you stupid fool! screeched the parrot.
