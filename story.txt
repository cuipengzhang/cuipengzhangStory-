 
Jim is buying a parrot

　　Are you sure it doesnt scream, yell, or swear? Jim asked

　　Oh absolutely. Its a religious parrot, the storekeeper assures him.

　　Do you see those strings on his legs? When you pull the right one, he recites the lords prayer, and when you pull on the left he recites the 23rd Psalm.

　　Wonderful!  Jim said, but what happens if you pull both strings? 


"Do not pull the both strings," said the storekeeper. 

    Jim found this quite strange, but as he was in a hurry to give the parrot as a gift to his daughter, Eva, he did not think too much. 

    "Have a good day." The storekeeper waved farewell to Jim with a poker-face, as he always is.

	When Jim returned home, he set up the parrot's cage and waited for Eva to get home from school. After a few hours, his daughter opened the door and squealed with delight at the sight of the colorful bird in front of her.

	"He's a religious parrot, too!" Jim exclaimed, only making Eva more excited. But as he said it, he worried about what would happen when Eva pulled on both of the strings at the same time.
